# Ieris Parent
This is the repository for all the Project Object Model (POM) 
configuration files that my projects use. It is a Maven project that
only produces POM artifacts. It is not meant to be used as a dependency
in other projects. It is meant to be used as a parent POM in order to
quickly configure new projects.

# Ieris Origin
Basically, this is a repository to gather templates for my new projects.
Beyond configuration files, it also contains other templates, for 
example, README files.

I don't know if this repository will be useful to anyone else but me, but 
I'm happy to share it in case anyone finds it useful.
